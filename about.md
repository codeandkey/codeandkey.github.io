Hello!

I'm Justin, a computer science and mathematics senior at Iowa State University.
I currently work in high performance computing and cluster management.

My current major interest is language and compiler design.
You can find all sorts of weird projects on my [GitHub](https://github.com/codeandkey). Feel free to check it out!
